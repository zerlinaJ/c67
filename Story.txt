Once upon a time, there lived a lion in the dense Amazon rainforest. While he was sleeping by resting his big head on his paws, a tiny little mouse unexpectedly crossed by and ran across the lionâ€™s nose in haste. This woke up the lion and he laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny mouse to kill her.
