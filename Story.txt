Once upon a time, there lived a lion in the dense Amazon rainforest. While he was sleeping by resting his big head on his paws, a tiny little mouse unexpectedly crossed by and ran across the lionâ€™s nose in haste. This woke up the lion and he laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny mouse to kill her.
The poor mouse begged the lion to spare her this time and she would pay him back on some other day. Hearing this, the lion was amused and wondered how could such a tiny creature ever help him. But he was in a good mood and in his generosity he finally let the mouse go.

I can't think of anything exciting.

Hey i know what i can write now,

Ok lets start again.

The mouse and the lion were best friends.
